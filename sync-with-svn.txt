 - Getting new chagnes from SVN will only work in the migration directory created by the svn2git tool
 - Proceeding requires SSH access to shell.devel.redhat.com
 - Assuming svn2git is installed (https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git)
 - Assuming below setup is present in your ~/.ssh/config and scp is configured for use

	Host devel
	  Hostname shell.devel.redhat.com
	  User $USER
	  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa


-------------
  PROCEDURE
-------------


 1. Copy the svn2git  directory from shell.devel.redhat.com

	scp -r devel:/home/remote/fkujikis/svn2git_repos/jbossws-projects-jaxbintros-svn2git /my/local/dir/jbossws-projects-jaxbintros-svn2git

 2. Extract authors file from this 'Doc' branch to accessible location, e.g.:

	cp authors.txt /tmp/svn2git/authors.txt

 3. Navigate to copied directory 

	cd /my/local/dir/jbossws-projects-jaxbintros-svn2git

 4. Ensure the authors file and SVN url are correctly referenced in .git/config

	gedit /my/local/dir/jbossws-projects-jaxbintros-svn2git/.git/config

	[core]
		repositoryformatversion = 0
		filemode = true
		bare = false
		logallrefupdates = true
	[svn-remote "svn"]
		url = http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbossws/projects/jaxbintros
		fetch = trunk:refs/remotes/svn/trunk
		branches = branches/*:refs/remotes/svn/*
		tags = tags/*:refs/remotes/svn/tags/*
	[svn]
		authorsfile = /tmp/svn2git/authors.txt

 5. Run svn2git with rebase options:

	svn2git --rebase

 6. Any new commits should now be present. The tool doesn't import new branches/tags so they have to be created manually:

	https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git/issues/87
 	https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git/issues/149

	For each missing tag recreate by:

		git show svn/tags/[TAG-NAME]
		# from the above get the commit ref and log

		git tag -a -m "[LOG MESSAGE]" [TAG-NAME] [COMMIT REF]

 7. When you have the right result:
	- push the new changes to the internal git repo
	- update devel:/home/remote/fkujikis/svn2git_repos/jbossws-projects-jaxbintros-svn2git with your local copy 
	  scp -r /my/local/dir/jbossws-projects-jaxbintros-svn2git devel:/home/remote/fkujikis/svn2git_repos/jbossws-projects-jaxbintros-svn2git
